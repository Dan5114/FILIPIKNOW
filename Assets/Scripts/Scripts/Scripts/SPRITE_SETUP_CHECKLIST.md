# ‚úÖ Sprite Setup Checklist

## üéØ You Already Have the Sprites!

I can see from your screenshot that you have:
- ‚úÖ `Choices Button1` (brown - default)
- ‚úÖ `Choices Button2` (green - correct)
- ‚úÖ `Choices Button3` (red - wrong)

Location: `Assets/Resources/ChoiceButton/` ‚úÖ

---

## üîß ONLY Setup Needed: Import Settings

### Step 1: Select All 3 Sprites
1. In Unity Project window
2. Navigate to `Assets/Resources/ChoiceButton/`
3. Click on `Choices Button1`
4. Hold **Shift** and click on `Choices Button3`
5. All 3 should be selected

### Step 2: Configure Import Settings
In the **Inspector** window (with all 3 selected):

1. **Texture Type**: `Sprite (2D and UI)` ‚Üê **MUST BE THIS!**
2. **Sprite Mode**: `Single`
3. **Pixels Per Unit**: `100`
4. **Filter Mode**: `Bilinear`
5. **Compression**: `Default`
6. Click **Apply** button

### Step 3: Verify
After clicking Apply, you should see the sprites have a small sprite icon (not a texture icon).

## ‚úÖ That's It!

Once you set **Texture Type to `Sprite (2D and UI)`**, the buttons will work!

### What Happens:
1. Code loads sprites: `Resources.Load<Sprite>("ChoiceButton/Choices Button1")`
2. Buttons default to brown (Choices Button1)
3. Click correct ‚Üí Changes to green (Choices Button2)
4. Click wrong ‚Üí Changes to red (Choices Button3)
5. Click Continue ‚Üí Resets to brown (Choices Button1)

---

## üß™ Testing After Setup

1. **Apply the import settings above**
2. **Play the scene**
3. **Check Console** for:
   ```
   ‚úÖ ChoiceButtonFeedback: Sprites - Default: True, Correct: True, Wrong: True
   ```
4. **Answer a question**
5. **Watch the button change color** and stay that color!
6. **Click Continue**
7. **Watch buttons reset** to brown

---

## üö® If Still Not Working

### Problem: Console shows "Sprites - Default: False, Correct: False, Wrong: False"

**Solution**: Sprites didn't load. Check:
1. Folder is exactly: `Assets/Resources/ChoiceButton/`
2. Names are exactly: `Choices Button1`, `Choices Button2`, `Choices Button3`
3. Texture Type is `Sprite (2D and UI)`
4. Restart Unity (sometimes needed to refresh Resources folder)

### Problem: Console shows sprites loaded but button doesn't change

**Solution**: Button structure issue. Check:
1. Your choice button GameObject has an **Image** component
2. The Image component has a sprite assigned
3. The ChoiceButtonFeedback component is on the same GameObject

---

## üí° Quick Debug

To see if sprites are loading, check the Console when you play:

**Success**:
```
ChoiceButtonFeedback on ChoiceButton1: Sprites - Default: True, Correct: True, Wrong: True
Added ChoiceButtonFeedback component to ChoiceButton1
```

**Failure**:
```
ChoiceButtonFeedback: 'Choices Button1' not found - using fallback
ChoiceButtonFeedback: Sprites - Default: False, Correct: False, Wrong: False
```

## ‚ú® Summary

**You have the sprites ‚úÖ**  
**You have the code ‚úÖ**  
**You just need ‚ö†Ô∏è**: Set Texture Type to `Sprite (2D and UI)`

**That's literally the only Unity setup needed!** üéâ
