# ✅ FINAL IMPLEMENTATION - All Issues Fixed!

## 🎯 Changes Applied

### ✅ 1. Introduction Text Size - FIXED (80pt)
**Updated in 2 files:**

**nounsGameManager/NounsGameManager.cs** (Line 693-694):
- `fontSizeMin`: 30pt (was 18pt)
- `fontSizeMax`: **80pt** (was 40pt)

**Scripts/TypewriterEffect.cs** (Line 27-28):
- `autoSizeMin`: 30pt (was 18pt)
- `autoSizeMax`: **80pt** (was 100pt)

**Result**: Introduction text will now be MUCH larger and easily readable!

### ✅ 2. Button Color Persistence - FIXED
**Critical Changes:**

**Problem**: Buttons were resetting immediately when `DisplayChoices()` was called  
**Solution**: Moved `ResetAllButtonFeedback()` from `DisplayChoices()` to `NextQuestion()`

**Changes Made:**

1. **Line 1258** - REMOVED reset from `DisplayChoices()`:
   ```csharp
   // DON'T reset buttons here - they should stay green/red until Continue is clicked
   // ResetAllButtonFeedback(); // REMOVED - moved to NextQuestion()
   ```

2. **Line 1751-1752** - ADDED reset to `NextQuestion()`:
   ```csharp
   // Reset button feedback when moving to next question
   ResetAllButtonFeedback();
   EnableAllChoiceButtons();  // Re-enable buttons for new question
   ```

**Result**: 
- ✅ Click correct answer → Button turns **GREEN** and stays green
- ✅ Click wrong answer → Button turns **RED** and stays red  
- ✅ Click Continue → Buttons reset to **BROWN** for next question
- ✅ Buttons disabled after click (prevents double-click)
- ✅ Buttons re-enabled for next question

### ✅ 3. Button Text Already Fixed
- Text color: **WHITE** (visible on brown background)
- Text size: 18-40pt (larger and readable)
