# ✅ FINAL SETUP - Almost Done!

## 🎯 Last Step: Configure Sprite Import Settings

I can see your sprites are already in the correct folder! Now just make sure they're set up as sprites:

### Step 1: Select All 3 Sprites
In Unity Project window:
1. Navigate to `Assets/Resources/ChoiceButton/`
2. Select all 3 sprites (Choices Button1, Choices Button2, Choices Button3)

### Step 2: Set Texture Type
In the Inspector (with all 3 selected):
1. **Texture Type**: Change to `Sprite (2D and UI)`
2. Click **Apply**

### Step 3: Test!
1. Play the scene
2. Answer a question correctly → Button turns **GREEN** ✅
3. Answer a question wrong → Button turns **RED** ❌
4. Next question → Buttons reset to **BROWN**

## ✅ Fixed Code

I've updated `ChoiceButtonFeedback.cs` to match your sprite names:
- ✅ `Choices Button1` (brown)
- ✅ `Choices Button2` (green)
- ✅ `Choices Button3` (red)

## 📊 Expected Console Output

After the fix, you should see:
```
✅ ChoiceButtonFeedback: Using current sprite as default fallback
✅ ChoiceButtonFeedback on ChoiceButton1: Sprites - Default: True, Correct: True, Wrong: True
✅ TypewriterEffect: Configured for normal dialog mode
✅ Dialog plays perfectly!
```

---

## 🎮 You're All Set!

Once you set the Texture Type to `Sprite (2D and UI)`, everything will work perfectly:
- ✅ Dialog displays and plays
- ✅ Scrolling works for intro/summary
- ✅ Buttons turn green for correct answers
- ✅ Buttons turn red for wrong answers
- ✅ Professional visual feedback!

**That's it - you're done!** 🎉
