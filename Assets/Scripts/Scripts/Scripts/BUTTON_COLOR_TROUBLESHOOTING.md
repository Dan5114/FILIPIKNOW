## üîç Why Buttons Might Not Be Changing Color

The code is correct, but there are 3 possible issues:

### Issue A: Sprite Import Settings
**Check this first!**

1. In Unity, go to `Assets/Resources/ChoiceButton/`
2. Select all 3 sprites (Choices Button1, Button2, Button3)
3. In Inspector, verify:
   - **Texture Type**: Must be `Sprite (2D and UI)`
   - **Sprite Mode**: `Single`
   - **Pixels Per Unit**: 100 (default)
   - **Filter Mode**: `Bilinear`
4. Click **Apply**

### Issue B: Button Structure
Your buttons need this structure:
```
ChoiceButton1 (GameObject)
‚îú‚îÄ Button (Component)
‚îú‚îÄ Image (Component) ‚Üê This changes color
‚îî‚îÄ Text (Child GameObject)
    ‚îî‚îÄ TextMeshProUGUI (Component)
```

**The Image component on the button itself must exist!**

### Issue C: Sprite Assignment
The button's **Image component** needs to have a sprite assigned initially.

## üß™ Testing Steps

### Step 1: Check Sprites Are Loaded
Play the scene and check Console for:
```
‚úÖ ChoiceButtonFeedback on ChoiceButton1: Sprites - Default: True, Correct: True, Wrong: True
```

If you see `False`, sprites aren't loading!

### Step 2: Test Button Click
1. Play the scene
2. Answer a question
3. Check Console for:
```
‚úÖ Button 0: Showing GREEN (correct)
```
or
```
‚ùå Button 0: Showing RED (wrong)
```

### Step 3: Visual Check
If Console shows success but button doesn't change:
- The **Image component** might not be on the button
- The **Image component** might be on a child instead

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Fix (If Needed)

If buttons still don't change, add this to your button setup:

### In Unity Editor:
1. Select a choice button in Hierarchy
2. Look at Inspector
3. Find the **Image** component
4. Make sure **Source Image** is set to your button sprite
5. **Important**: The Image component should be on the SAME GameObject as the Button component

---

## üìä Expected Behavior

### When Correct:
1. Click button
2. Console: `"‚úÖ Button X: Showing GREEN"`
3. Button sprite changes to **Choices Button2** (green)
4. Button disabled
5. Next question ‚Üí Reset to brown

### When Wrong:
1. Click button
2. Console: `"‚ùå Button X: Showing RED"`
3. Button sprite changes to **Choices Button3** (red)
4. Button disabled
5. Next question ‚Üí Reset to brown

---

## üîç Debug Mode

Add this to check what's happening:

### In ChoiceButtonFeedback.cs, the ShowCorrect() method logs:
```csharp
Debug.Log($"{gameObject.name}: Showing CORRECT feedback (green)");
Debug.Log($"Current sprite: {buttonImage.sprite?.name}");
Debug.Log($"Correct sprite: {correctSprite?.name}");
```

Check Console to see if sprites are actually assigned!

## ‚úÖ Quick Checklist

Before reporting it's not working, verify:

- [ ] Sprites are in `Assets/Resources/ChoiceButton/`
- [ ] Sprite names are EXACTLY: `Choices Button1`, `Choices Button2`, `Choices Button3`
- [ ] Texture Type is `Sprite (2D and UI)` for all 3
- [ ] Button has an **Image** component (not just child text)
- [ ] Console shows sprites loaded: `Sprites - Default: True, Correct: True, Wrong: True`
- [ ] Console shows feedback triggered: `"Button X: Showing GREEN/RED"`

## üéØ Most Common Issue

**90% of the time**, the problem is:
1. Texture Type not set to `Sprite (2D and UI)`, OR
2. The Image component is on a child object instead of the button itself

**Fix**: Select all 3 sprites ‚Üí Inspector ‚Üí Texture Type ‚Üí `Sprite (2D and UI)` ‚Üí Apply

Then play again!
